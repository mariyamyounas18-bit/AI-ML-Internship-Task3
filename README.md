Heart Disease Prediction — DevelopersHub AI/ML Internship Task 3
### Task Objective
Predict whether a person is at risk of heart disease based on health data using machine learning models.

### Dataset Used
- Heart Disease UCI Dataset from Kaggle

### Models Applied
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier

### Key Results and Findings
- Logistic Regression Accuracy: 1.0 (based on uploaded dataset)
- Decision Tree Accuracy: <your DT accuracy>
- Decision Tree feature importance: 0.0
- Most important features (Logistic Regression): cp, thalach, oldpeak
- Note: The dataset used differs slightly from the standard Kaggle dataset. All steps (EDA, train/test split, model training, evaluation, feature importance) follow Task 3 instructions.

### How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Upload `heart.csv` when prompted
3. Run all cells sequentially

### Additional Notes
- The notebook includes clear comments and visualizations for all steps:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC Curve
  - Feature Importance
